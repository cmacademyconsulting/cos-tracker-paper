## 📘 Abstract  
Donor‑funded infrastructure projects often face fragmented compliance records, weak oversight, and limited transparency in sustainability reporting. The **COS™ Blockchain Compliance Tracker** integrates the Compliance, Oversight, and Sustainability (COS™) framework with blockchain‑based logging to create **immutable, verifiable audit trails**.  

Proof‑of‑concept demonstrations on Westend/Paseo testnets confirm feasibility, with **Tx IDs serving as audit‑ready references**. The system enhances trust for donors, reduces risks for project managers, and assures communities of **ethical and sustainable project delivery**.

## 📊 COS Audit Tracker — On‑Chain Proofs  
All COS™ audit events have now been immutably logged on the **Westend Asset Hub** using `system.remark` extrinsics from the **COS DEMO ACCOUNT (Talisman)**.

## 🏆 Strategy: Ethics‑First Approach  
The COS™ Tracker is built on three pillars:  

- **Compliance:** Immutable audit trails tied to ESG milestones.  
- **Oversight:** Transparent governance with verifiable Tx IDs.  
- **Sustainability:** Ethical assurance for communities and donors.  

This ethics‑first methodology positions COS™ as a **pathfinder for global governance innovation**, ensuring that blockchain is not just a technical tool but a **cultural commitment to integrity and trust**.
