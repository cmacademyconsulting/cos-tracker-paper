## 📘 Abstract
Donor-funded infrastructure projects often face fragmented compliance records, weak oversight, and limited transparency in sustainability reporting. The COS™ Blockchain Compliance Tracker integrates the Compliance, Oversight, and Sustainability (COS™) framework with blockchain-based logging to create immutable, verifiable audit trails. Proof-of-concept demonstrations on Westend/Paseo testnets confirm feasibility, with Tx IDs serving as audit-ready references. The system enhances trust for donors, reduces risks for project managers, and assures communities of ethical and sustainable project delivery.
